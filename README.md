### Financial Products Sales & Profitability Analysis

_An Interactive Power BI Dashboard for Sales Optimization_

---

### Overview

[cite_start]This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Microsoft Financial Products dataset, focusing on sales trends, profitability, and customer behavior[cite: 19]. The core deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to evolve from basic metrics into a robust visualization tool. Key design decisions, including the implementation of a **secondary Y-axis** to effectively compare **Sales vs. Discount/Profit trends**, were made to address complex research questions. [cite_start]The resulting dashboard enables stakeholders to filter performance by key dimensions (Segment, Country) and compare metrics across time to facilitate precise, data-driven decisions for business optimization[cite: 20].

### Business Problem

* [cite_start]Analyze how product sales perform across different countries[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]Identify the **most profitable product lines**[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]Compare branch and city-wise performance[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]Analyze customer type and payment method trends[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]Track sales growth over time[cite: 26].

### Research Questions & Key Findings

1.  **Top product by Profit contribution?**
    [cite_start]→ **paseo product** has the highest contribution in double profit[cite: 41].
2.  **Which segment generates the highest Sales and Profit?**
    [cite_start]→ **government segment** generates highest profit[cite: 43].
3.  **Which Products have the highest Profit Margin %?**
    [cite_start]→ **paseo product** has the highest profit margin, double the product price[cite: 45].
4.  **Which Countries are the most profitable in each Segment?**
    [cite_start]→ **France** is the most profitable country overall in the segment analysis[cite: 47].

### Final Recommendations

* [cite_start]**Expand the government sector** due to its high profit contribution[cite: 55].
* [cite_start]Increase sales for low-performance products like **carretera** and address the **mid market** segment which is low in profits[cite: 56].
* [cite_start]Encourage continued focus on **France** as it is a high-profit country[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]Increase product stocks in **September**, which is noted as having the highest sales[cite: 58].
