## ðŸ§¾ Financial Products Sales & Profitability Analysis

_An Interactive Power BI Dashboard for Sales Optimization_

---

### Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Microsoft Financial Products dataset, focusing on sales trends, profitability, and customer behavior. The core deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to evolve from basic metrics into a robust visualization tool. Key design decisions, including the implementation of a **secondary Y-axis** to effectively compare **Sales vs. Discount/Profit trends**, were made to address complex research questions. The resulting dashboard enables stakeholders to filter performance by key dimensions (Segment, Country) and compare metrics across time to facilitate precise, data-driven decisions for business optimization.
